# Web_Visualizations_Dashboard

For this project, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from my weather visualization project. 
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which the user can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where the user can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where they can view the data used to build them.
